#Use the previous number of cluster to perform a K-means cluster analysis
#• Analyse the “silhouette” of the clusters
#• Plot on the space of the first two dimensions of the PCA the clusters obtained with K-means, using a different
#colour for each cluster.
#• For each cluster, which “original” variables (ex ante the PCA) are more important? Consider the barycenter of
#each cluster (the barycenter is an observation) and its variables values.
#• Using both the information of barycenters and of PCA, give an interpretation to each cluster.
